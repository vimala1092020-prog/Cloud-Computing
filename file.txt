 Most of us have seen a tortoise in a zoo or a reptile park. However, not many 
would have seen its marine relative, the sea turtle. This is not surprising, since these 
reptiles spend almost their entire life in the sea.
 There are seven species of marine or sea turtles 
in the world. Of them, five are found in India’s coastal 
waters: the Olive Ridley, the Hawksbill, the Green Sea 
Turtle, the Loggerhead and the Leatherback. Compared 
to most tortoises, sea turtles are huge. Even the smallest 
species, the Olive Ridley, weighs up to 35 kg when fully 
grown. The largest of them all, the Leatherback, grows to a 
length of 2.2m and each could weigh as much as 700 kg!
 The Olive Ridley
 Sea turtles live their life entirely in the oceans. But they still have a connection 
with land – they must come ashore to lay eggs. Today, four of the sea turtle species 
mentioned above have become extremely rare in India. The Olive Ridleys, however, are 
still commonly seen nesting on sandy beaches all along our coasts.
